# Open Questions

Decisions not yet made. Each says what it blocks, so work can be sequenced around it.

**When a question is answered:** write an [ADR](decisions/), then delete the entry here.
Questions do not linger once resolved.

## Blocking

None currently. Q1, Q2 and Q3 were resolved on 2026-08-10 — see
[ADR 0023](decisions/0023-retention-retainage-enabled.md),
[ADR 0024](decisions/0024-onboarding-base-currency-and-fiscal-year.md) and
[ADR 0025](decisions/0025-configurable-tax-engine.md).

## Non-blocking

Q6 (data import mechanism) and Q7 (permissions mechanism) resolved 2026-08-10 — see
[ADR 0027](decisions/0027-generic-column-mapping-import.md) and
[ADR 0028](decisions/0028-dynamic-namespaced-permissions.md). Q7's actual role/permission
*list* is still deferred to Phase 4, per those docs.

### Q8 — Second customer profile
**Blocks:** Nothing yet — but shapes Phase 3 and the plugin design

The extensibility strategy in [extensibility.md](architecture/extensibility.md) warns against
over-abstracting before a real second customer exists. Knowing who that is — and how their
process actually differs — would let us validate the rate-dimension model against a real case
instead of a hypothetical one.
