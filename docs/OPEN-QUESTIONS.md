## Blocking

### Q13 — Negative stock policy

**Blocks:** Phase 2 stock transaction engine completion

Should an issue that would take an item/location below zero be blocked, allowed with a warning,
or controlled by a per-company setting? Allowing it makes AVCO undefined and can make apparently
precise cost figures fictional. The current recommendation in [stock.md](domain/stock.md) is to
block by default, potentially configurable per company, but the configuration scope and any
exception workflow need an explicit decision before stock movements ship.

### Q14 — Backdated stock receipts

**Blocks:** Phase 2 valuation engine completion

If a receipt is entered before already-costed issues, should the system recalculate every later
valuation forward, or reject backdating past the latest affected issue? Forward recalculation is
more flexible but substantially more complex and must preserve posted history once GL integration
exists; blocking is simpler but constrains operations. Decide the initial policy and how it will
interact with closed accounting periods before Phase 2 ships.

Q1, Q2 and Q3 were resolved on 2026-08-10 — see

[ADR 0024](decisions/0024-onboarding-base-currency-and-fiscal-year.md) and
[ADR 0025](decisions/0025-configurable-tax-engine.md).

## Non-blocking

Q6 (data import mechanism) and Q7 (permissions mechanism) resolved 2026-08-10 — see
[ADR 0027](decisions/0027-generic-column-mapping-import.md) and
[ADR 0028](decisions/0028-dynamic-namespaced-permissions.md). Q7's actual role/permission
*list* is still deferred to Phase 4, per those docs. Q9 (exchange rate source) resolved
2026-08-19 — see [ADR 0031](decisions/0031-manual-exchange-rate-entry.md). Q11 (stock valuation
method) resolved 2026-08-20 — see [ADR 0032](decisions/0032-per-item-valuation-method.md). Q12
(multi-supplier catalog) resolved 2026-08-20 — see
[ADR 0033](decisions/0033-item-suppliers-relationship.md).

### Q8 — Second customer profile
**Blocks:** Nothing yet — but shapes Phase 3 and the plugin design

The extensibility strategy in [extensibility.md](architecture/extensibility.md) warns against
over-abstracting before a real second customer exists. Knowing who that is — and how their
process actually differs — would let us validate the rate-dimension model against a real case
instead of a hypothetical one.

### Q10 — Sharing master data across a customer's own legal entities
**Blocks:** Nothing in Phase 1. Relevant once a customer wants more than one legal
entity/branch under one login.

`company_id` is the full tenant-isolation boundary
([GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md#company), [ADR 0004](decisions/0004-multi-tenancy-ready-schema.md)),
not a legal-entity subdivision within one customer. Today, "multi-entity support" means another
row in `companies`, isolated from its sibling exactly as strictly as from an unrelated tenant —
the only planned bridge is user membership across `company_id`s
([multi-tenancy.md](architecture/multi-tenancy.md)'s planned tenant-switching UI), not shared
data. There is no construct for sharing a specific record — e.g. a trading partner in
[parties.md](domain/parties.md) — between two legal entities of the same real customer without
also exposing it to unrelated tenants.

Surfaced while deciding [ADR 0030](decisions/0030-unified-party-model.md) (a global, unscoped
`parties` table was considered and rejected as the wrong fix for this). Options when it becomes
real: a parent "account" grouping above `company_id`; per-record cross-company sharing grants; or
accept duplication and reconcile via an external key. Not decided — no second legal entity
exists yet to design against.
